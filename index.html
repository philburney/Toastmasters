            <p>A key element of our meetings, as with any Toastmasters meeting, is that all speaking is evaluated. Evaluation is a review of the way the speech was presented (not normally its content) and consists of finding those areas which came over well, alongside those areas which demonstrated a need for development. All evaluations are supportive and are intended to help speakers improve their speaking technique. It is not the role of club members to 'criticise' each other, the objective is to create an atmosphere where learning can be fully supported.</p>
